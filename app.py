    Each tip should start with a relevant emoji.

    <ul>
        <li>üíß **Water Management:** Ensure consistent watering to prevent blossom-end rot. Drip irrigation is highly effective.</li>
        <li>üêõ **Pest Control:** Regularly inspect for hornworms and use neem oil as a natural pesticide.</li>
        <li>üå± **Soil Health:** Maintain a soil pH between 6.2 and 6.8 and enrich with compost before planting.</li>
